# 📊 Student Exam Score Analysis

This project explores the factors that influence student exam performance using Python.  
We analyze how **study hours, attendance, sleep, and previous scores** affect final exam outcomes.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `student_exam_scores.csv` → Dataset containing student study and performance information  
- `students.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations  

---

## 🔎 Key Analysis
- Distribution of exam scores  
- Correlation between study hours, attendance, sleep, and exam results  
- Group-level insights (e.g., low/medium/high study levels)  
- Relationship between previous scores and current performance  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build predictive models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
- Evaluate which factors have the strongest influence on exam outcomes  

---

## 📌 Example Insights
- Hours studied has the strongest positive correlation (**0.78**) with exam scores  
- Attendance has a weak correlation (**0.23**)  
- Sleep has a very weak correlation (**0.19**)
